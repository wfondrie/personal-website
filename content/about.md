## Hi, I'm Will. 

I'm a computational biologist working as a postdoctoral fellow in [Bill Noble's
lab](https://noble.gs.washington.edu) in the University of Washington Department
of Genome Sciences. My research primarily focuses on employing machine learning
to make sense of mass spectrometry data (including, but not limited to
proteomics). I received my PhD in 2018 from the University of Maryland,
Baltimore, under the direction of [Dudley
Strickland](http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Strickland-Dudley/) and
[David Goodlett](http://goodlettlab.org/).  

Outside of science I enjoy good coffee, being outside, playing banjo, and riding
my [fixed-gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle) around town.

## About This Site.  
The posts here are an eclectic mix of things related to my research and hobbies.
You'll likely find a mix of tutorials, paper highlights, and observations about
proteomics, mass spectrometery, data science, and machine learning. All opinions
and views expressed on this site are my own and do not represent the views of my
employer.  

This site was made using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R
package. It's powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the
