# Hi, I'm Will. 

I'm building a data science team at [Talus Bio](https://talus.bio), where we develop drugs to target previously untargetable gene regulatory proteins. 
My team and I develop AI-enabled software to analyze mass spectrometry data and maximize what we can learn from it.


Previously, I was a postdoc in [Bill
Noble's](https://noble.gs.washington.edu) lab in the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences.
I received my PhD from the University of Maryland, Baltimore, under the direction of [Dudley Strickland](http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Strickland-Dudley/) and [David Goodlett](http://goodlettlab.org/).

Outside of science I enjoy good coffee, hiking, playing banjo, and riding my fixie around Seattle. 
I also serve as an amateur audio engineer at our church, [Cross & Crown](https://www.crossandcrownchurch.com/).
