## Hi, I'm Will.

I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow working on the computational side of mass spectrometry and proteomics with [Bill Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences. My current research focuses on two areas I find interesting: protein-protein interactions and neoantigen discovery. In both cases, I'm working on methods to improve peptide identification in mass spectrometry experiments, whether from cross-linked samples or peptide antigens. 

My PhD research was performed under [Dudley Strickland](http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Strickland-Dudley/) and [David Goodlett](http://goodlettlab.org/) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. There I worked on experimental and computational methods for gaining biological insight from mass spectrometery data. This included several biological domains, such as protein-protein interactions, exosome biology and identifying microbial pathogens.  

Outside of science I enjoy good coffee, the outdoors, playing banjo, and riding my [fixed-gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle) around town.
