# Hugo Marmot

## A minimal, monospace theme for Hugo.

Marmot is a Hugo theme written by [Will Fondrie](https://willfondrie.com), because he didn't like the maintenance burden of his former theme. Thus, he started from [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.org) [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) Hugo theme and build his own. It was also inspired by Radek's [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) Hugo theme.

## Features

- Easily configurable colors using vanilla CSS variables:
``` css
:root {
    --dark-color: #000000;
    --light-color: #EEEEEE;
    --accent-color: #24B8A0;
    --bg-color: #1d1f21;
}
```

- Support for code highlighting using [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).
- Support for mathematical expressions using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
